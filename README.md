# React Flow Node Clustering Issue

## 🚨 Problem Description

**Issue**: React Flow nodes cluster together at one position while edges render separately in their correct positions.

### Visual Evidence
- **Nodes**: All nodes appear at the same position (0,0) despite having different position data
- **Edges**: Render correctly in their intended layout positions
- **Minimap**: Shows correct node positions but main view clusters everything

### Expected Behavior
- Nodes should be distributed according to their position data
- Edges should connect to the correctly positioned nodes
- Drag and pan interactions should work naturally

## 🔍 Current Symptoms

1. **Node Position Data**: Correctly defined with different x,y coordinates
2. **DOM Transform**: All nodes show `transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)` instead of proper translations
3. **Minimap Display**: Shows nodes in correct positions (proving data integrity)
4. **Edge Rendering**: Edges appear in correct positions but don't connect to clustered nodes

## 🛠️ Environment

- **React Flow**: `@xyflow/react` v12.x
- **React**: v18.x
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Runtime**: Electron + Node.js
- **Platform**: macOS

## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Problem Location
The issue appears to be in `GraphViewer.jsx` where React Flow's internal position → transform conversion fails.

### Key Findings
1. **Data Integrity**: ✅ Position data is correct
2. **Minimap Rendering**: ✅ Uses same data and renders correctly
3. **Main View Transform**: ❌ Fails to apply position data to DOM transforms
4. **React Flow State**: ❌ Internal state seems to lose position information

### Attempted Solutions
- ✅ Direct DOM transform manipulation (temporary fix, breaks interactions)
- ✅ React Flow key reset for re-initialization
- ✅ Various `useEffect` timing adjustments
- ✅ React Flow v11 → v12 migration verification
- ❌ **None provide complete solution**

## 🚀 How to Reproduce

### Problem Version (CodeVisor)
```bash
cd problem-version
npm install
npm run dev:renderer
# Open http://localhost:5250
# Load any project → nodes cluster at center
```

### Working Version (Standalone)
```bash
cd working-version/react-flow-analysis
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:8080
# Nodes display correctly distributed
```

## 📋 Investigation Checklist

- [ ] React Flow v12 migration completeness
- [ ] `useNodesState` hook initialization patterns
- [ ] ReactFlowProvider configuration differences
- [ ] Viewport and coordinate system conflicts
- [ ] Transform calculation pipeline analysis
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing

## 🎯 Desired Outcome

**Goal**: Identify the exact cause of position → transform conversion failure and implement a minimal fix that:
1. Maintains natural React Flow behavior
2. Preserves drag, pan, and zoom interactions
3. Keeps nodes and edges properly synchronized
4. Works consistently across different layouts

## 💡 Expert Assistance Needed

Looking for React Flow experts who can:
1. Identify the root cause of position transformation failure
2. Suggest minimal code changes to fix the issue
3. Ensure solution maintains React Flow's native interaction model
